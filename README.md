# Welcome to CDK TypeScript project

This projects demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkWorkshopStack`)
which contains an API Gateway that will trigger Lambda Function when the endpoint is hit.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
